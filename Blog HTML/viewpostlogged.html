                        <h2>New Solar Collector Tech Could Lower Costs for Concentrating Solar Power</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        A new solar collector is starting a trend when it comes to concentrating solar power (CSP)
                        technology. For the first time ever, “ganged heliostats” could be a viable option for new CSP
                        systems.

                        Skysun, a startup out of Bay Village, Ohio, developed the new design that could help cut the
                        cost of a CSP system by more than 30%.

                        GANGED HELIOSTAT TECHNOLOGY
                        CSP technologies use mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto receivers that collect
                        solar energy and convert it to heat. The mirrors, also known as heliostats, typically require
                        their own base, foundation, and motor.

                        Skysun’s solar collector groups together heliostats through shared motors and support
                        structures, which has the potential to cut the total installed cost of CSP systems in half.
                        While other ganged heliostat concepts have previously been proposed, none of them have shown to
                        be cost competitive or viable—until now.

                        Picture of a ganged heliostat installed at Sandia National Laboratories National Solar Thermal
                        Test Facility.
                        Ganged heliostat prototype installed at Sandia National Laboratories' National Solar Thermal
                        Test Facility.
                        SkySun partnered with Sandia National Laboratories through a $275,000 Small Business Vouchers
                        project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SunShot Initiative. Sandia reported that
                        Skysun’s ganged heliostats can achieve an average price point around $80/m2. That’s 33% lower
                        than the lowest average cost for today’s conventional heliostats ($120/m2) and close to the
                        SunShot Initiative’s goal of lowering the cost of solar collectors to $75/m2.

                        PATH TO MARKET ADOPTION
                        Skysun’s biggest barrier was showing that the technology is not just comparable to current
                        heliostats in terms of performance, but more affordable. They used a grant from Innovation Fund
                        America to build their first lab-scale prototype, then worked with Sandia to model and optimize
                        the system. Alongside Sandia, Skysun designed custom codes for mirror positioning to reduce
                        shading from other mirrors within the system, making its peak efficiency comparable to those
                        deployed today. So far, modeling on Skysun’s solar collectors show that its mirrors achieve CSP
                        industry accuracy standards with winds up to 15-20 miles per hour.

                        Skysun founder Jim Clair believes he will be able to leverage the outcomes from Skysun’s
                        collaboration with Sandia in his search for a strategic partnership to prepare this technology
                        for market adoption. Describing Sandia as “the mecca for CSP,” Clair said Sandia’s support in
                        demonstrating the ganged heliostat’s stability, performance, and cost will be instrumental in
                        showing the technology’s viability to potential partners.
